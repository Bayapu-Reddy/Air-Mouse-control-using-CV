✋ AI Hand Gesture Mouse Control

Control your computer cursor using hand gestures—no physical mouse needed!
This project uses OpenCV + MediaPipe + PyTorch to track hand landmarks and translate them into mouse actions in real-time 👇

## 🚀 Features

| Gesture | Action |
|--------|--------|
Move Index Finger | Move Mouse Cursor
Thumb + Index PIP near | ✅ Single Click
Thumb + Middle Finger near | ✅ Right Click
Index + Middle close | ✅ Scroll Up
Thumb + Ring Finger close | ✅ Scroll Down
Thumb + Index Tip near | ✅ Click & Drag (Press/Release)
Index Tip + Middle Tip | ✅ Double Click

✅ Real-time Webcam detection  
✅ Visual hand landmark overlay  
✅ Smooth cursor control  
✅ Gestures mapped to OS mouse events  
✅ Saves recording as `out.avi
